#summary package structure used in the destal

= Introduction =

The destal-open-world game contains two applications, client and server. Since we are planning to separate these two applications, we created two packages, destal.client and destal.server.
Of course, there are classes both application have in common. For theses files, there is a third package named destal.shared
