== Introduction ==

The project _destal open-world_ is, as the name say, an open-world game that will be published under the terms of the GNU GPL v3.
The main idea of the game is adapted from the game minecraft, with the little difference that _destal open-world_ is a 2D game whereas minecraft is implemented 3-dimensional.

The projects includes the development of the destal open-world server and the destal open-world client. The client application enables the user to play the singleplayer mode along with some computer generated characters (animals, several kinds of enemies etc.).
Using the server enables the possibility to enter the multiplayer mode and therefore to play via LAN against or with other _real_ players.
