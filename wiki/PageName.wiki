#Data structure of the World
=Data structure of the World=

==General information==
The World of destal-open-world is divided twice: First of all, it has several levels the player can move on. However, every level is divided into smaller areas, the so-called "Chunks". They provide a faster loading of the map since they enable to control how much of the world - or better: of the current level - should be loaded.
Right now, we are planning to simultaneously load nine chunks - the current one plus the eight ones around it.

==Data structure of the World==
A world file uses the extension _.wld_.
_*TODO:*Further information on world files_

==Data structure of the Levels==
A level file uses the extension _.lvl_.
_*TODO:*Further information on level files_

==Data structure of the Chunks==
A Chunk file uses the extension _.chnk_. One chunk file has the size of exactly four kilobytes. It contains information of a 64x64 square of blocks which specify the Chunk.
